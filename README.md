Re-implementing some of the fundamental C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers, including:
   - Vector: dynamic array that can grow and shrink as needed.
   - Map: associative container that stores key-value pairs in sorted order.
   - Stack: last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.


The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of how these data structures work and how they can be implemented in C++. 
We are required to implement these containers as classes or structures and ensure that they provide the same interface and functionality as their STL counterparts.
The project typically includes requirements for iterator classes, handling edge cases, and optimizing the performance of the containers. 
It's a comprehensive project that requires a good grasp of C++ and data structures.

Here are some key aspects of the "ft_containers" project:

. Template Classes: The project often requires the use of C++ template classes to create generic containers that can store different types of data.
. Iterators: We must implement iterator classes for their containers, allowing users to iterate through the elements stored in the container.
. Memory Management: Proper memory management, including allocation and deallocation, is a crucial aspect of this project.
. Correctness and Efficiency: The re-implemented containers should not only produce correct results but also be efficient in terms of time and space complexity. 
   We are encouraged to consider performance optimizations.
. Testing: Thorough testing of the implemented containers is essential to ensure they work correctly. This may involve writing test cases and comparing 
   the results of the custom containers with the STL containers.
. Documentation: Providing documentation and comments in the code to explain the implementation and usage of each container is often part of the project requirements.
. Conformance: The custom containers should conform to the expected behavior and interface of the original STL containers to be considered successful.
